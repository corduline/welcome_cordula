```

## Create a repository

- You have to fill out the name.

- Make sure the repository is not totally empty. The easiest is to tick initialize with README.  That will create a blank REAMDE.md file. 

Try it with something different than welcome_cordula.  You will receive at the end welcome_cordula from my repostiory.

```{r step1, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step1.png'))
```

You will get here

```{r step2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step2.png'))
```

## Installation of Git and Synchronizing with RStudio

You have to refer to this [article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) but very briefly. This needs to be done. I use Windows 10, I think you use Mac, right?  Must be very straightforward.


##Using GitHub in RStudio

File / Start a new project, and select version control. 

```{r step3, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step3.jpg'))
```

Choose Git

```{r step4, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step4.jpg'))
```

Clone from Git Repository. Just copy + paste your repository URL that you created in the first step.

```{r step5, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step5.png'))
```

Now just to follow me, create any new file. You can also copy your existing project here. In the picture below, I am creating this Welcome.Rmd file for you!

```{r step6, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step6.png'))
```

##Synchronizing

Now I made my screenshots, saved them to `images/` and RStudio+Git added a few other files, too, including the rather important `.gitignore.` (Do not delete it.)

If you click Git in the window pane for `Environment / History / Connections / Git`, then you will see all your synchronized files with green, deleted with red, and others that wait to be synchronized with yellow. 

```{r step7, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step7.png'))
```

Time to synchronize them. Tick all the new files.


```{r step8, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step8.png'))
```

Now press Commit.  A new window will pop up where you can review all changes in all ticked files. 

```{r step9, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step9.png'))
```

It is mandatory to fill in a description.  I typed `initial commit`. After writing a short description and pressing Commit again, it will prepare everything to be uploaded. It is not yet uploaded.  For example, you can choose to do Commit for each file, writing a short reminder what did you change in them. 

```{r step10, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step10.png'))
```

When ready, press Push, and it will do the upload.


##Check it out and download it to your computer

You can check it out here on [https://github.com/antaldaniel/welcome_cordula](https://github.com/antaldaniel/welcome_cordula).


You can press Fork (I cannot show it, because I would have to use your computer to do this trick, which would be only possible if I would be behind your desk in Budapest.)

If you press fork, you can import this as 
https://github.com/corduline/welcome cordula. You can get these files, and write your questions or anything nice in a file, referring to step 3 __Using GitHub in RStudio__.  

If you need help, create a repository, I can fork it, make amendments, and let you know how you can get it back, I cannot show it right now.  


##Redeiving what you did

I go back to my repository. 

```{r step10, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step11.png'))
```

I make a __comparison accross forks__.

```{r step12, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step12.png'))
```

I choose your fork, and I got a comparison.

What can go wrong? Usually if there are more than 2 collaborators, and the forks are crossing each other, that can cause a problem. But that is not a concern now. 


It says. 
 __Able to merge__. These branches can be automatically merged.
 
 
```{r step13, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step13.png'))
```

The master branch belongs to me, because I started this demo.  I leave a comment when I merge your modifications. I type 

>I will try to merge this!

.. and press __Create pull request__.

It will check that in the meantime we did not cross-post each other. 

```{r step14, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step14.png'))
```

Evertything is fine, I will bring your modification into my repository.

```{r step15, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step15.png'))
```

##Downloading your first contribution

Back to RStudio, where I press the Pull button.

```{r step16, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path('images', 'step16.png'))
```
